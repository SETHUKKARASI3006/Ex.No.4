### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223230201
### Aim: 
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.

### Prompt:
```
How can self-driving cars prioritize safety when navigating crowded intersections?
```

### Output:

Great fusion of two forward-thinking topics: autonomous vehicle safety and AI-powered predictive maintenance. Let’s tackle both with precision.

## 🚗 Part 1: Self-Driving Cars at Crowded Intersections

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) prioritize safety at complex intersections using a blend of technologies and decision-making models:

### 🔍 Key Safety Strategies
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from LiDAR, radar, cameras, and GPS to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles—even in blind spots.
- **Risk Modeling**: Uses probabilistic models to estimate collision risk when visibility is obstructed (e.g., buildings blocking line of sight). MIT’s model, for instance, evaluates uncertainty and advises whether to stop, merge, or inch forward.
- **Intelligent Intersections**: Infrastructure-based sensors provide AVs with real-time traffic data, signal phases, and pedestrian movement to enhance situational awareness.
- **Predictive Control Algorithms**: These anticipate the behavior of other road users and adjust AV actions accordingly—especially useful in unregulated intersections or roundabouts.
- **Connectivity**: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication allows AVs to “talk” to traffic lights and nearby cars for coordinated movement.

## 🛠️ Part 2: AI Prompts for Predictive Maintenance Experiment

To guide your experiment, here’s a set of AI prompting techniques tailored to each phase:

### 📊 1. Data Collection Prompts
**Technique: Instructional Prompting**
- “Extract vibration, temperature, and pressure readings from all CNC machines every 10 minutes.”
- “Log operational status and error codes from PLC systems during peak and off-peak hours.”

**Technique: Role-Based Prompting**
- “As a factory technician, describe the most common failure modes observed in the last 6 months.”

### 🧠 2. Model Training & Analysis Prompts
**Technique: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
- “Given a spike in motor temperature and increased vibration, reason through whether this indicates bearing wear or misalignment.”
- “Analyze the time-series data and identify patterns that precede motor failure.”

**Technique: Few-Shot Prompting**
- “Here are three examples of sensor anomalies that led to machine downtime. Use these to classify new anomalies.”

### 📈 3. Predictive Insights & Optimization Prompts
**Technique: Goal-Oriented Prompting**
- “Predict the likelihood of failure for each machine in the next 7 days and recommend optimal maintenance windows.”
- “Rank machines by urgency of maintenance based on historical failure rates and current sensor readings.”

**Technique: Comparative Prompting**
- “Compare the performance of XGBoost vs LSTM models for predicting gearbox failure. Which offers better accuracy and explainability?”

### 📝 4. Report Generation Prompts
**Technique: Structured Output Prompting**
- “Generate a maintenance report summarizing predicted failures, recommended actions, and expected cost savings.”
- “Create a dashboard-ready summary of machine health metrics with color-coded risk levels.”
